This is project covers everything what we learned in two semesters: JavaFx application, SQL databases..

It might be tricky to start the app,
because you will need add jdbc connector to the library 
and you will need running mySql server..

This app has a login function created in mySql databese,
it is able to keep the list of friends that user has added,
also user is able to post and see other users (only friends) posts.
